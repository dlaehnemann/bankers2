# Genotype intersections across samples:
@SMPS NA00003 NA00002 NA00001
# The first 3 lines contain the counts for missing values of each sample in the order provided
#   in the SMPS-line above. Intersection counts only start afterwards.
# Subset intersection counts are in global banker's sequence order.
#   After exclusive sample counts in order of the SMPS-line, banker's sequence continues with:
#   NA00003,NA00002   NA00003,NA00001   ...
# [1] Number of shared non-ref genotypes
